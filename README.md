# OLS

## What is this package for?

This package is built for solving linear regression model using ordinary least 
square method. There are three functions in the package in total, OLS, CI and AOV.
OLS is the main function in the model, it helps build linear model and computes all
necessary parameters such as coefficients, residuals and degree of freedom. Also, 
it gives a nicely presented summary section which provides all hypothesis tests of 
coefficients. CI and AOV are additional functions that enrich the model. CI gives
confidence interval for all variables and AOV gives the analysis of variance table.
The package has the same function with the built-in R function lm() and provides same results with similar efficiency.
